Newsweather
===

A dumb browser-based dashboard for news headlines and hourly weather forecast. Good for finding a use for a leftover tablet.

The headlines are fetched from YLE and the forecast is fetched from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

The weather symbols are from [FMI](https://github.com/fmidev/opendata-resources).

Setup
---

Copy the file `static/js/fmi-api-key.js.sample` to `static/js/fmi-api-key.js` and fill your FMI API key in.

Copy the file `static/js/email-addresses.js.sample` to `static/js/email-addresses.js` and modify it to your needs.

Copy the file `.env.sh.sample` to `.env.sh` and fill in the above email addresses along with a SendGrid API KEY.

Development
---

Run `./node_modules/.bin/nodemon -e js,html,css server.js`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
